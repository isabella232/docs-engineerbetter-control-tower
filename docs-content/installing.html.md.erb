To install the Control Tower for Concourse file on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, do the following:

1. Download the binary file from Pivotal Network.

2. Install it into your `PATH`.

3. You can choose to rename the file at your convenience.</br>
Please note that the name of the file you choose will be the same as the command ran against your deployments. For example:

```sh
$ control-tower deploy --iaas gcp <deployment-name>
```
if the binary is renamed `control-tower`, or</br>

```sh
$ ctwr deploy --iaas aws <deployment-name>
```
