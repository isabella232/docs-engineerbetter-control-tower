Choose the best type of instances to cater to your needs.

- On AWS
  - `--spot=value`</br>
    You can choose your Concourse workers to be set as spot instances. Can be true/false. (Default is true.)

    > Control Tower uses spot instances for workers as a cost saving measure. Users requiring lower risk may switch this feature off by setting `--spot=false`.</br>

- On GCP
  - `--preemptible=value`</br>
      You can choose your Concourse workers to be set as preemptible instances. Can be true/false. (Default is true.)

  <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: Be aware the [preemptible instances](https://cloud.google.com/preemptible-vms/) _will_ go down at least once every 24 hours so deployments with only one worker _will_ experience downtime with this feature enabled. BOSH will ressurect falled workers automatically.</p>

`spot` and `preemptible` are interchangeable so if either of them is set to false then interruptible instances will not be used regardless of your IaaS. i.e:<br>

- Results in an AWS deployment using non-spot workers:

```sh
$ control-tower deploy --spot=true --preemptible=false <your-project-name>
```
- Results in an AWS deployment using non-spot workers:

```sh
$ control-tower deploy --preemptible=false <your-project-name>
```
- Results in a GCP deployment using non-preemptible workers:

```sh
$ control-tower deploy --iaas gcp --spot=false <your-project-name>
```

##<a id='Estimated Costs'></a>Estimated Costs

By default, Control Tower deploys to the AWS `eu-west-1` (Ireland) region or the GCP `europe-west1` (Belgium) region, and uses spot instances for large and xlarge Concourse VMs.</br>
The estimated monthly cost is as follows:
